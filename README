SchedulingEngine
=================

SchedulingEngine is a flexible scheduling engine for large-scale radio telescope arrays, or, more generally, a scheduling framework for scheduling independent, but possibly compatibly jobs (running at the same time).

=== Building ===
 * go into directory
   $  mvn package
   Then you should see jars in the target directory, notably engine-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

==== Developing ===
I recommend Eclipse to browse the source code.
 Add the 
   git plugin http://download.eclipse.org/egit/ and the
   maven plugin http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/
Then Import > Maven Project

The maven documentation can be found at http://maven.apache.org/
JGAP is the Genetic Algorithm library used.
